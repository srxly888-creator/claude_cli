# Claude Code Playbook — Agents, Skills, Hooks & Workflows

English | **[中文](README.md)**

A practical playbook for getting real work done with Claude Code: project memory, subagents, skills, hooks, MCP, and practical guides for using Claude CLI.

中文：学习并掌握 Claude Code CLI - 工作流、代理、技能、钩子、插件与实战指南。

## Quick Start: Claude CLI Workflow Entry

If you only want the shortest path for OpenClaw inbox triage + Claude CLI repo executor, start with [OpenClaw Inbox Triage Execution Checklist](docs/OPENCLAW_INBOX_TRIAGE_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md).

This fork refreshes the tutorial path against Anthropic's current Claude Code docs as of **March 24, 2026**.

## Beginner Recommendation: GStack Structured Roles

If you're new to Claude Code, you can treat **GStack** as a strong on-ramp. It gives you structured roles and stable entry points, which makes it easier to begin than staring at a blank prompt every time.

### Why this layer helps beginners

A lot of first-time Claude Code users get stuck on the workflow, not the commands:

1. They do not know how to start because the prompt is too empty.
2. They do not have a structure for what to ask first.
3. They treat the model like a generic assistant instead of a role-based collaborator.
4. The output becomes inconsistent and too generic.

GStack's value is that it gives you a role-based entry point up front, so you can collaborate in a more stable way instead of rebuilding the context from scratch each time.

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git ~/.claude/skills/gstack
cd ~/.claude/skills/gstack
./setup
```

### 6 roles worth learning first

1. **`/office-hours`** - product office hours for rethinking direction and requirements.
2. **`/plan-ceo-review`** - CEO / founder perspective for direction and priority tradeoffs.
3. **`/plan-eng-review`** - engineering manager perspective for architecture and implementation breakdowns.
4. **`/review`** - senior engineer perspective for code review and risk checks.
5. **`/qa`** - QA lead perspective for testing and edge cases.
6. **`/ship`** - release engineer perspective for release readiness and delivery steps.

If you want to understand GStack before folding it into your own Claude Code workflow, start with the upstream [GStack repository](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack).

## Start Here

Pick the path that matches where you are right now:

1. **[10-minute setup](CLAUDE_SETUP.md)** — install Claude Code, log in, create your first `CLAUDE.md`, learn the few commands that matter most.
2. **[New project workflow](HOW_TO_START_NEW_PROJECT.md)** — go from idea to plan to implementation using the tools in this repository.
3. **[Existing project workflow](HOW_TO_START_EXISTING_PROJECT.md)** — retrofit Claude Code into a codebase that already exists.
4. **[Personal assistant / knowledge system workflow](HOW_TO_START_ASSISTANT_SYSTEM.md)** — use Claude Code for a personal assistant, reflection system, or knowledge workflow instead of only software delivery.
5. **[assistant-os starter templates](docs/assistant-os-starter/README.md)** — copy-ready `reference_manifest.md` and protocol templates for the smallest usable system.
6. **[Create subagents](HOW_TO_CREATE_AGENTS.md)** — build project-specific specialists with `/agents`.
7. **[Create skills](HOW_TO_CREATE_SKILLS.md)** — package repeatable prompts and workflows in `SKILL.md`.
8. **[Refactor rough existing subagents](docs/REFACTOR_EXISTING_SUBAGENTS.md)** — shows how to split old mega-agents into narrow roles and move repeated procedures into skills.
9. **[Subagent refactor starter](docs/subagent-refactor-starter/README.md)** — copy-ready `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/` examples for a minimal role split.
10. **[OpenClaw vs Claude agents](docs/OPENCLAW_AND_CLAUDE_AGENTS.md)** — a detailed comparison of OpenClaw agents, OpenClaw subagents, and Claude CLI subagents, plus recommended complementarity patterns.
11. **[Long-lived assistant system + Claude CLI integration guide](docs/ASSISTANT_CLAUDE_INTEGRATION.md)** — explains how any assistant outer loop, bot, reminder system, or control layer can hand work into Claude CLI repo workflows, and what “sharing MCP” should mean in practice.
12. **[OpenClaw + Claude CLI workflow scenarios](docs/OPENCLAW_CLAUDE_WORKFLOW_SCENARIOS.md)** — breaks the model into concrete choices: outer loop, inner loop, bridge artifacts, or repo-only work.
13. **[OpenClaw Inbox Triage + Claude CLI Repo Executor](docs/OPENCLAW_INBOX_TRIAGE_REPO_EXECUTOR.md)** — keeps only the most practical “intake, classify, route, execute in repo” pattern.
14. **[OpenClaw Inbox Triage Execution Checklist](docs/OPENCLAW_INBOX_TRIAGE_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md)** — compresses the workflow into a direct runbook.
15. **[Assistant team patterns](docs/ASSISTANT_TEAM_PATTERNS.md)** — practical patterns for splitting work, life, and reflection assistants.
16. **[Official reference map](docs/OFFICIAL_REFERENCE_MAP.md)** — see which Anthropic docs back each guide in this repo.

## What Changed In This Tutorial Refresh

The original docs were useful, but parts of the onboarding path had drifted away from the current Claude Code experience. This refresh focuses on:

- **Modern official entry points**: `/init`, `/agents`, `/memory`, `/permissions`, `/mcp`, `/hooks`, and Plan Mode.
- **Stable mental models**: `CLAUDE.md` for memory, subagents for specialists, skills for reusable workflows, hooks for deterministic automation.
- **Better visibility for advanced features**: frontmatter, status line scripts, and filesystem read controls now show up earlier instead of being buried in deeper docs.
- **Safer execution**: plan first for risky work, keep permissions explicit, and use hooks only when you need behavior that must always run.
- **Better team onboarding**: clearer learning paths, project-vs-user scope guidance, and stronger documentation on when to create local tools.
- **Current through 2026 Q1 details**: the main path now calls out 1M context, prompt caching, tool search, `rate_limits`, and `sandbox.filesystem.allowRead`.

## Core Concepts In 60 Seconds

| Concept | What it is | Use it when |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Shared memory for a project | You want Claude to consistently remember commands, architecture, conventions, and risks |
| Subagents | Specialized workers in `.claude/agents/` or `~/.claude/agents/` | A task benefits from a dedicated role with a focused prompt and tool set |
| Skills | Reusable capabilities in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, with frontmatter for invocation, forked execution, and effort | You want a repeatable workflow, custom command, or domain-specific playbook |
| Hooks | Deterministic automation in `settings.json` | Something must always happen before or after a tool event |
| MCP | External tools and data sources | Claude needs access to GitHub, Jira, Figma, databases, internal services, or other tool servers |
| Plan Mode | Read-only planning mode | You want Claude to analyze safely before it edits or runs commands |

If you're new, do not start with custom hooks or a pile of agents. Start with `CLAUDE.md`, a clean workflow, and one or two focused extensions.

Many people first read skills as "saved prompts." Modern `SKILL.md` files are more than that: frontmatter can control automatic invocation, forked execution, and reasoning depth. The three fields worth noticing early are usually `disable-model-invocation`, `context: fork`, and `effort`.

---

## Recommended Baseline For Every Repository

Before you install any extra tooling, set up this baseline:

1. Run `claude` in the project root.
2. Run `/init` and create a useful `CLAUDE.md`.
3. Record the real commands Claude should use: build, test, lint, format, dev server, and deployment notes.
4. Add architecture notes, naming conventions, and risky directories.
5. Use `/permissions` to reduce repetitive approvals only after you know which commands are safe.
6. Use Plan Mode for larger refactors or unfamiliar code.
7. Add subagents only for recurring specialist roles.
8. Add skills only for workflows you repeat often.
9. Add hooks only when you need deterministic enforcement, not just advice.

This repository's agents and skills work best on top of that baseline.

---

## Easy-To-Miss 2026 Q1 Details

- Skills are not just prompt snippets. Modern `SKILL.md` files support frontmatter for invocation style, forked execution, and reasoning effort.
- 1M context makes long sessions easier to use, but it does not mean you should keep piling on stale history forever. Use `/compact` when you stay on the same task, and `/clear` when the task has changed.
- Claude Code already handles part of the cost and context optimization story automatically through prompt caching, auto-compaction, and tool search when MCP tool descriptions get heavy.
- Newer status line and sandbox features are worth surfacing too: status line scripts can read `rate_limits`, and `sandbox.filesystem.allowRead` can reopen specific read paths inside a broader denied region.

## Suggested Learning Path

### Path A — Brand New To Claude Code

1. Read [CLAUDE_SETUP.md](CLAUDE_SETUP.md)
2. Create a `CLAUDE.md` with `/init`
3. Try a few small tasks in a real repo
4. Read [HOW_TO_START_EXISTING_PROJECT.md](HOW_TO_START_EXISTING_PROJECT.md)
5. Install one component from this repo, not all of them at once

### Path B — You Already Use Claude Code But Want Better Workflows

1. Read [HOW_TO_START_EXISTING_PROJECT.md](HOW_TO_START_EXISTING_PROJECT.md)
2. Install `global-doc-master`
3. Install `global-review-doc` and `global-review-code`
4. Add `doc-scanner` if your projects are doc-heavy
5. Add project-specific subagents and skills only after patterns stabilize

### Path C — You Want To Build Your Own Extensions

1. Read [HOW_TO_CREATE_AGENTS.md](HOW_TO_CREATE_AGENTS.md)
2. Read [HOW_TO_CREATE_SKILLS.md](HOW_TO_CREATE_SKILLS.md)
3. Study the examples in `agents/`, `skills/`, and `hooks/`
4. Version project-level tools with the repo and keep user-level tools personal

### Path D — You Want A Personal Assistant Or Knowledge System

1. Read [CLAUDE_SETUP.md](CLAUDE_SETUP.md)
2. Read [HOW_TO_START_ASSISTANT_SYSTEM.md](HOW_TO_START_ASSISTANT_SYSTEM.md)
3. Start from the templates in [docs/assistant-os-starter/README.md](docs/assistant-os-starter/README.md)
4. Then read [docs/ASSISTANT_TEAM_PATTERNS.md](docs/ASSISTANT_TEAM_PATTERNS.md)
5. Start with a small working system, not a mega-assistant
6. Add subagents and skills only after the rhythm becomes stable

---

## Workflow This Repo Teaches

```text
1. Capture context   ->  /init + CLAUDE.md + existing docs
2. Plan the change   ->  doc master + Plan Mode + review
3. Build in slices   ->  focused prompts, skills, and subagents
4. Review the code   ->  global-review-code
5. Test and iterate  ->  run commands, inspect results, document fixes
6. Preserve context  ->  flow docs, issue docs, resolved docs
```

This is intentionally documentation-first. Claude gets better when the project has durable memory and explicit workflows.

---

## If You Want A More Detailed Workflow

If the direction is clear but the exact operating flow still feels too abstract, go straight to one of these:

1. **Existing repo workflow**: read [HOW_TO_START_EXISTING_PROJECT.md](HOW_TO_START_EXISTING_PROJECT.md)
   Best when you already have a codebase and want to add `CLAUDE.md`, flow docs, review loops, skills, and subagents gradually.
2. **New project workflow**: read [HOW_TO_START_NEW_PROJECT.md](HOW_TO_START_NEW_PROJECT.md)
   Best when you are still in planning and want to go documentation first, then review, then implement in slices.
3. **Long-lived assistant outer loop + Claude CLI inner loop**: read [docs/ASSISTANT_CLAUDE_INTEGRATION.md](docs/ASSISTANT_CLAUDE_INTEGRATION.md)
   Best when you want a long-lived assistant to handle intake, reminders, and routing, while Claude CLI handles concrete repo execution.
4. **How to choose a concrete scenario**: read [docs/OPENCLAW_CLAUDE_WORKFLOW_SCENARIOS.md](docs/OPENCLAW_CLAUDE_WORKFLOW_SCENARIOS.md)
   Best when you want a quick decision tree for outer loop, inner loop, bridge docs, or repo-only work.
5. **Just the intake-to-execution path**: read [docs/OPENCLAW_INBOX_TRIAGE_REPO_EXECUTOR.md](docs/OPENCLAW_INBOX_TRIAGE_REPO_EXECUTOR.md)
   Best when you only care about the most common and stable outer-loop / inner-loop split.
6. **Just the smallest runbook**: read [docs/OPENCLAW_INBOX_TRIAGE_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md](docs/OPENCLAW_INBOX_TRIAGE_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md)
   Best when you already know the task and want a direct step-by-step checklist.

If your main question is simply whether OpenClaw agents and Claude CLI subagents are the same thing, read:

- [docs/OPENCLAW_AND_CLAUDE_AGENTS.md](docs/OPENCLAW_AND_CLAUDE_AGENTS.md)
